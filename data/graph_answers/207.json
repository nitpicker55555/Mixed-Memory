"Based on the memory graph, the events that took place at Washington Square Park involved an ice sculpture exhibition organized by Dakari Liebert. During this event, Benjamin Green, an ice preservation expert, attended the exhibition. Creed Berlin discussed the ice sculptures with Benjamin Green, apparently unaware of Benjamin's expertise in the field. Additionally, Jonah Kramer visited the exhibition and enjoyed it with Henry Reed, while Karsyn Schaeffer taught Henry Reed how to carve ice. These activities focused on the exhibition and interactions related to ice sculptures."
