"On February 27, 2026, at Washington Square Park, Benjamin Green, identified as an Ice Preservation Expert, attended the ice sculpture exhibition organized by Dakari Liebert. Creed Berlin, an Ice Sculpture Enthusiast, discussed the ice sculptures with Benjamin Green, unaware of his expertise. Therefore, Benjamin Green was a participant at this event and engaged in discussions about the ice sculptures."
