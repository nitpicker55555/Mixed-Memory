# Memory Graph Project

This project implements a memory graph system for processing and analyzing episodic memory data from books and events. It provides tools for building, visualizing, and analyzing memory graphs based on narrative content.

## Repository

This project is hosted on GitHub: [https://github.com/nitpicker55555/Mixed-Memory.git](https://github.com/nitpicker55555/Mixed-Memory.git)

## Features

- **Memory Graph Construction**: Builds R graphs (relationship networks) and L dictionaries (semantic labels)
- **Data Processing**: Loads and processes events, meta-events, books, and graph answers
- **Visualization**: Creates visual representations of memory graphs
- **Analysis Tools**: Provides utilities for analyzing graph structures and relationships
- **Book-to-Graph Pipeline**: Converts book content into a Neo4j graph
- **Graph-based QA**: Answers questions using the Neo4j graph and stores Q&A pairs

## Data Format

### Events (`events.json`)
Contains event data with timestamps, descriptions, and relationships.

### Meta Events (`meta_events.json`)
Contains higher-level event groupings and semantic information.

### Books
Structured book content with chapters, paragraphs, and metadata.

### Graph Answers (`graph_answers/`)
Contains graph-based question-answer pairs for evaluation.

### Questions and Answers (`questions.json`)
Stores all user questions and the corresponding answers generated by the QA system.

## QA Workflow

1. **Book to Graph**: Use `neo4j_book2graph.py` to convert a book into a graph and store it in Neo4j.
   ```bash
   python neo4j_book2graph.py
   ```
   This script will:
   - Read the book from the data/books/ directory
   - Use GPT to extract nodes and relationships
   - Store the resulting graph in your Neo4j database

2. **Question Answering**: Use `neo4j_gpt_qa.py` to answer questions based on the Neo4j graph.
   ```bash
   python neo4j_gpt_qa.py
   ```
   This script will:
   - Load the graph schema from Neo4j
   - Read questions (and optionally answers) from `questions.json`
   - Use GPT and Cypher to answer each question
   - Store all Q&A pairs in `questions.json`

3. **Review Q&A**: All questions and answers are stored in `questions.json` for further analysis or evaluation.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from process_data import DataProcessor

# Initialize data processor
processor = DataProcessor()

# Load all data
events, meta_events, books, graph_answers = processor.load_all_data()

# Create story text from events
story_text = processor.create_story_text(events)

# Generate memory graph
from memory_graph_builder import MemoryGraphBuilder
builder = MemoryGraphBuilder()
R_graph, L_dict = builder.build_memory_graph(story_text)
```

### Running the Main Pipeline

```bash
python main.py
```

### Data Processing

```bash
python process_data.py
```

### Book to Graph and QA Pipeline

```bash
# Step 1: Convert book to Neo4j graph
python neo4j_book2graph.py

# Step 2: Run QA over Neo4j graph
python neo4j_gpt_qa.py
```
